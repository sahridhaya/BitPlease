Among these chapters,
Chapter 10- The Minimum Polynomial, is a small chapter with not much problems to be solved and the
	     types of problems are proofs and verifications.
Chapter 11- Computer Assistance, is the MAPLE interpretation of the problems in this book.
Chapter 12- Solutions to the Exercises, which are the solution to the exersice problems provided in the textbook.
 
In this book the amount of solved examples are generally very less, so inclusion of exercise questions
are done to increase the number of solved questions as the exercise questions are also solved in this 
textbook. Total of 42( Numerical) questions solved.
Some of the chapters also dont contain enough questions to be solved numerically, they are marked 
in ' Readme.txt ' file in those folders.
