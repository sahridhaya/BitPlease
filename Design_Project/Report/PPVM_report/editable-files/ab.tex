This project addresses the issue of plastic pens as a waste in the environment. A data analysis conducted within GEC, Barton Hill, TVM, revealed that most students do not refill their pen and the effective disposal of plastic pens is not carried out. All the used pens are disposed of along with other plastic waste. Most of them are burned in the open air, which emits a large amount of CO$_2$. Thus, it adds up to environmental pollution. This project is an earnest effort to mitigate up to some extent, the emission of CO$_2$ into the atmosphere, through the implementation of Paper Pen Vending Machine (PPVM). This machine accepts three used plastic pens as a means to collect used pens and returns one seed-implanted paper pen to the user to spread environmental consciousness. Through the implementation of the PPVM within the campus, it is estimated that the emission of one tonne of CO$_2$, into the atmosphere, can be avoided every year.
